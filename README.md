# Dish RAG: Recipe Recommender with AI Assistant

Welcome to our Recipe Recommender project! This application leverages an AI Assistant to provide users with personalized recipe suggestions based on their available ingredients, dietary preferences, and time constraints. Below you’ll find an overview of what we’re building, how the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) works, and a glimpse into future enhancements.

**1. Project Overview**

The core idea is to allow users to input what ingredients they have on hand, how much time they have to cook, and any dietary or baby-friendly constraints. The application will then generate recipe suggestions in a chat-style interface. Users can continue the conversation, asking follow-up questions or requesting substitutions.

We also enable users to upload their own recipes, which are incorporated into future recommendations. A feedback mechanism allows users to rate the recipes or the suggestions from the AI, helping us continually refine and improve the recommendations.

**2. MVP User Experience
**
The MVP user flow is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, focusing on these primary goals:

Simple Input of Criteria: Users enter their available ingredients, select a maximum cook/prep time, and optionally check dietary or baby-friendly filters.
Chat-Centric Suggestions: Once they submit, users are greeted by an AI assistant that provides a set of recipe suggestions.
Conversational Interaction: Users can chat back and forth with the AI – for example, asking if they can substitute an ingredient or requesting a different type of dish.
Recipe Details and Viewing: When a recipe is suggested, users can expand to view the full recipe details, ingredient list, and instructions.
Recipe Upload: Users can upload their own recipes (via text or file), optionally tagging them (e.g., vegan, baby-friendly, etc.). The new recipes become part of the system’s recommendation set.
Feedback Gathering: After trying a recipe, users can rate it (1-5 stars) and leave comments to help improve future suggestions.
The interface in the MVP will be minimalistic but user-friendly:

A simple form on top (or on the side) for ingredient input, time selection, and dietary toggles.
A chat window that displays the conversation with the AI assistant.
A “New Chat” or “Reset” button to clear the conversation and start fresh.
A “View Details” or “Expand Recipe” option for each suggestion to see the full recipe.
A “Feedback” panel to rate and comment on recipes.

**3. Future Enhancements**

While the MVP is primarily focused on the core functionality of recipe discovery and basic user uploads, we have several enhancements planned:

Advanced Search and Filtering
- Smart filtering based on nutritional values (calories, macros).
- More granular cook/prep time ranges or “time to serve” scheduling.
Enhanced AI Suggestions
- Natural language processing for more complex prompts (e.g., “I’m having a party of 8, want something vegan with a spicy kick”).
- Personalized profiles that learn from users’ cooking history and feedback.
Collaboration/Sharing
- Social sharing features: share recipes with friends or within a community.
- Collaborative recipe lists: plan potlucks or group meals.
Multimedia Support
- Built-in image recognition for uploaded recipes.
- Video integration (step-by-step cooking videos).
Deeper Feedback and Analytics
- More nuanced feedback prompts (ingredient-specific feedback).
- Analytics that highlight trending recipes or personalized weekly meal plans.

With these planned additions, we hope to evolve from a basic recipe suggestion tool into a comprehensive, AI-driven cooking companion.
